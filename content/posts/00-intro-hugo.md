## Introduction

Since a couple of years I own two (2) domain names, but did not really do much with it.
Most callebaut domains have been purchased by 'Barry Callebaut', a chocolate manufacturer. But I stumbled upon 2 domains (.io and .dev) I could use for personal use.

the .dev domain is mainly used for my development and operations ramblings, the .io domain remained unused. Until now.

[Callebaut.io](https://callebaut.io) is now the proud home of my personal webspace.

## My requirements

For starters I just want my website to be simple hub with a couple of links to specific websites I use to build an online presence.
I did not have much of requirements, but forced myself to write a couple of them down.

- it needs to be simple, lightweight and easy to maintain
- I'm not much of a designer, so I would like to use a framework supporting templates
- keep options for blogging, etc open
- I already have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a ruby based static site generator, experience since the [BEPUG.dev](https://bepug.dev) website runs it, and wanted to try something different.
- the theme ideally should support a light\dark mode

## Themes

Browsing different themes on the internet I stumbled upon [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), another popular static site generator.
My theme of choice is [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) as it has quite some build in features and meets most if not all requirements.

- profile mode
- social icon support (remember the profile hub requirement)
- no nodejs, etc dependencies
- blog capabilities
- out-of-the-box light and dark mode 
- ...

And so my personal webspace was conceptulazid.

The next posts describe the creation and deployment of my personal website and serve more as a personal 'how did I do things'.
